# Chess Position Evaluator

This repository contains a binary classifier using KNN and SVM models to evaluate whether white or black is winning in a given position. Draws are omitted. This report was created for a university course.

In the future, a Lichess bot will be created, more models will be implemented and a continuous output will be added instead of the binary output.
